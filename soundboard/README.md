# P2W Soundboard

Soundboard application created for our friends at P2W. This application will have the following features:
- User login.
- User permissions.
- Uploading of audio clips. (Most likely restricted to super user accounts)
- List of people who have available audio clips.
- Listening to clips with a visual appearance. (Created something like this on [DARKNET.FM](https://github.com/nicer00ster/darknet.fm) - will most likely re-use styling/logic for this feature)
- Like/dislike feature?
- Comments could be cool.
